# ottoriot's ghost custom theme

Welp, here we are, in the world of massive dependencies and so many goddamn files. We've ceased to be engineers and are nothing more than duct tapers. We take a bunch of random shit and glue it all together to make a great big jenga tower.

Count me in!

Oh yeah. I love managing dependencies. Because javascript just isn't enough. 6,000+ lines of glorious json to fuck up.
